    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 30 September 2024</p>

    <p>
      This Privacy Policy explains how "Lek" by Blank Canvas Designs Private
      Limited handles and protects your personal data. By using the app, you
      acknowledge and agree to the practices described below.
    </p>

    <h2>1. General Information</h2>
    <p>
      "Lek" is an iOS application that allows users to create AI-generated
      LinkedIn posts using keyboard input or voice-to-text transcription. While
      most data is stored on the user’s iPhone, certain data is transmitted to
      OpenAI for processing to help create the posts.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Data Collection and Transmission</h2>
    <p>
      When you use "Lek" to create posts, some of the input data (e.g., text or
      voice transcriptions) is transmitted to OpenAI’s servers to generate
      personalized content using AI. This data is processed by OpenAI solely for
      the purpose of generating content based on your input and is not stored by
      Blank Canvas Designs Private Limited.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>
      We do not retain any of your personal data or content after the AI process
      is completed. All data remains stored on your device after the AI
      generation is completed, and we do not store any user data on external
      servers.
    </p>

    <h2>4. User Control and Data Deletion</h2>
    <p>
      You have full control over the data stored on your device. Deleting the
      app from your iPhone will permanently delete all associated data, and no
      information will remain with Blank Canvas Designs Private Limited. Data
      transmitted to OpenAI is processed in real-time for content generation and
      is not retained for future use.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Third-Party Data Processing (OpenAI)</h2>
    <p>
      Data provided to OpenAI is subject to OpenAI’s privacy policy. OpenAI
      processes your data only to provide the requested AI-generated content. We
      encourage you to review OpenAI’s privacy policy for more information on
      their data practices.

    <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      Our app is not intended for children under 13 years of age. We do not
      knowingly collect or store data from individuals under 13, and if we
      become aware that such data has been provided, it will be promptly
      deleted.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Security</h2>
    <p>
      While we ensure that the app follows best practices for security within
      the iOS environment, we recommend users take standard precautions to
      protect their device, such as using strong passwords and enabling device
      security features.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. You will be notified
      of any significant changes through an update in the app. The latest
      version of the Privacy Policy will always be available within the app and
      on our website.
    </p>
